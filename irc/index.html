				<h1>Grid12 IRC</h1>

				<h3>Info</h3>
				<div text>
					<p>
					There's an IRC channel for Grid12 over on Sorcery (same server as the
					realm IRC). The address is: <code>irc.sorcery.net #Grid12</code>. You can access the
					chat using any client (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_IRC_clients">here</a>
					for a list of clients - <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.sorcery.net/#grid12">KiwiIRC</a> is a
					web-based one that works everywhere), or just use the widget at the top
					of the page.
					</p>
					<p>
					IRC is a text chat system. There is no support for voice or video chat.
					(I know, this seems obvious, but no less that four people have asked
					me how to talk over irc.)
					</p>
					<p>
					OPs: amitp, David, Frogboffin, Malroth.
					</p>
					<p>
					Rob goes by robjetbolt, and Tim goes by timjetbolt.
					</p>
					<p>
					You'll probably want to register your nick to prevent people from
					impersonating you. To do so, select a nick you like by doing <code>/nick
					myname</code>, and then (if the nick isn't already taken) type the following
					command into the chat (make sure there's no space before the first
					slash!):
					</p>
					<p>
					<code>/msg nickserv register mypasswordhere myemail@address.com</code>
					</p>
					<p>
					The email parameter is optional. Next time you log on, choose your nick and type:
					</p>
					<p>
					<code>/msg nickserv id mypasswordhere</code>
					</p>
					<p>
					to identify yourself; your nick will be changed in 60 seconds if you don't identify yourself.
					</p>
					<p>
					Current beta testers are indicated by voice (+v). If you're a beta
					tester, make sure you're registered and identified, and then ask an
					op to add you to the access list.
					</p>

				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<div text>
					<ul>
						<li>
						No spamming. Period. Anyone who spams the chatroom maliciously is liable to be kicked without warning. Spambots will be banned on sight.
						</li>
						<li>
						If something is longer than 10 lines, don't paste it in the chat. Put it on pastebin or something similar.
						</li>
						<li>
						Don't spam the chatroom asking for invite codes. Asking nicely once or twice is okay, but filling the page up with begging is not acceptable or using mass pings (i.e. putting everyone's name in your chat message) is not acceptable.
						</li>
						<li>
						Do not impersonate others. Impersonating a developer or an OP is strictly forbidden. Please let us know if somebody is impersonating you (proof helps if we've never seen you before).
						</li>
						<li>
						Be civil and treat others as you would like to be treated, and don't harass or annoy others (joking around is fine, deliberate baiting, trolling, or flaming is not). I'm not going to write down any hard-and-fast rules for this; use your best judgement. If your behavior crosses the line you will be warned through either pubchat or PM; continuation of the offending behavior will result in a kick, and, if it persists, a ban.
						</li>
						<li>
						Label NSFW links as NSFW. Some people chat over here from work - let's not get them fired.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					If you have any comments or complaints about the chatroom (any, really!), report them to an OP. We don't know what your user experience is like if you don't tell us!
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Want an invite code?</h3>
				<div text>
					<p>
					Post on the IRC and answer these three questions. If nobody on the IRC gives you a code (either because everyone's AFK or because nobody was sufficiently impressed), don't lose hope - you can still apply on the forums.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
						Who are you? Briefly introduce yourself.
						</li>
						<li>
						Why do you want an invite code?
						</li>
						<li>
						Why should we give you an invite code? What would you contribute as a tester?
						</li>
					</ul>
